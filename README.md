# Face Recognition
Face Recognition using Face_recognition library
Need ffmpeg file in the folder. Currently, it only works for YouTube links.

It processes one frame per second, which needs improvement.
According to Cprofile, _raw_face_locations takes 1.057 seconds per call, 
so we may need to change the library into another.
Not sure Yolo can work on Face recognition.
